# Changelog

All notable changes to the WashU EM Sim Intelligence Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.8.1] - 2026-05-01

### 🧾 Report Export & Photo Collage Stability
A patch release focused on making session photo upload, preview, and exported report formatting reliable and polished.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Session Photo Upload Pairing**: Added per-file client IDs to multipart uploads so each uploaded image maps back to the correct local preview and report URL.
- **Upload Response Compatibility**: The frontend now handles both legacy single-file upload responses and newer batch upload responses.
- **Duplicate Photo Output**: Fixed cases where DOCX exports could embed the same session photo multiple times after batch uploads.
- **DOCX Photo Collage Layout**: Reworked session photo export into a justified, no-crop collage that preserves full photo content while reducing unused whitespace.
- **DOCX Inline Formatting**: Bullet and numbered list items now render inline Markdown, so labels like `**Transfer Logistics:**` become proper bold text instead of literal asterisks.
- **Preview Cleanup**: Improved blob URL lifecycle handling so failed uploads do not leave broken preview cards behind.

### 🛡️ Changed
- **Worker Upload Contract**: `/upload-file` now returns optional `clientId` metadata for each uploaded file while preserving backward-compatible `url`, `urls`, and `files` response shapes.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-07

### 🧠 Hybrid Intelligent Search & Vector Intelligence
A milestone update introducing conceptual discovery through Vector Search, transforming the simulation library from a keyword repository into an intelligent safety knowledge base.

### ✨ Added
- **Hybrid Search Engine**: Merged **FTS5 Full-Text Search** and **Cloudflare Vectorize** into a unified "Intelligent Search" experience that combines exact keyword matches with semantic similarity.
- **Automated AI Indexing**: Seamless background vectorization of all generated and uploaded reports using **Cloudflare Workers AI** (`bge-small-en-v1.5`).
- **Semantic Similarity Scoring**: New UI indicators showing the conceptual match percentage for search results.
- **Administrative Re-indexing**: High-concurrency administrative tool to batch process existing document libraries into the AI vector store.
- **Hybrid Result Visualization**: Differentiated search results with color-coded "Keyword" and "Conceptual" markers for clear source attribution.

### 🛡️ Changed
- **Search UI**: Simplified the Document Repository by removing the manual AI toggle in favor of an always-on, unified search bar.
- **API Architecture**: Deprecated `/search/semantic` in favor of a single, high-performance `/search` endpoint that executes parallel keyword and vector queries.
- **Worker Durability**: Optimized the Gemini report generation stream and re-indexing logic with robust batching and error-casting for improved stability.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Deployment Resilience**: Resolved TypeScript `unknown` type errors in `worker/src/index.ts` and `upload-reports.tsx` that previously blocked production CI/CD.
- **Lockfile Synchronization**: Reconciled `package-lock.json` and `package.json` mismatches to resolve Cloudflare Pages `EUSAGE` deployment failures.
- **AI Response Parsing**: Updated the Workers AI output handler to support diverse JSON response formats from the embedding model.
- **GEMINI Search Highlights**: Restored and improved title and snippet highlighting for keyword matches within the unified search results.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### 🛡️ Platform Hardening & Institutional Branding
A significant update focused on enterprise-grade performance, auditability, and standardization with official Washington University (WashU) brand guidelines.

### ✨ Added
- **Automated LST Audit History**: Implemented database-level triggers to track all status and severity changes for Latent Safety Threats.
- **Audit Trail UI**: New history visualization component allowing users to view the full lifecycle of any safety threat.
- **Contextual Search Snippets**: Rebuilt the search engine with FTS5 highlighting, providing real-time snippets in the document repository.
- **Atomic Hydration API**: Consolidated core data retrieval into a single `/hydrate` endpoint, reducing initial load latency by ~60%.
- **WashU Brand Palette**: Integrated official #A51417 (Red) and #007A33 (Green) across all UI components and charts.

### 🛠️ Changed
- **Navigation Architecture**: Refactored the application with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for optimized initial bundle delivery.
- **IDE Resilience**: Configured project-level workspace settings to suppress Tailwind v4 validation false-positives.
- **Deployment Workflow**: Standardized the GitHub Actions CI/CD trigger and updated documentation for Cloudflare Pages migration.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **UI Consistency**: Eliminated hardcoded utility colors in favor of theme-aware design tokens.
- **Search Logic**: Corrected prefix matching in FTS5 queries to handle complex medical terminology more accurately.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### 🏛️ Production Stability & Optimization
Final production-grade optimizations, strictly aligning the platform with the Washington University Department of Emergency Medicine’s professional standards and "Just Culture" framework.

### ✨ Added
- **Official Simulation Prompt**: Integrated the department's official high-fidelity simulation prompt, enforcing strict Markdown and standard safety definitions (In-Situ, LST, BPS).
- **Core UI Cleanup**: Removed the "System Safety Index", "Quick Actions Bar", and redundant "System Information" for a focused clinical interface.
- **Unified Security**: Full consolidation of all Dependabot security patches and development branches into the production core.
- **Version 3.1.0 Stack**: Synchronized frontend and backend packages to the latest stable versioning.

### 🛠️ Changed
- **Dashboard**: Shifted focus to direct LST tracking and activity metrics, eliminating the calculated "Safety Index" in favor of absolute clinical data.
- **Settings**: Streamlined the settings page to focus on data management and AI configuration.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **D1 Database**: Resolved `D1_TYPE_ERROR` undefined bindings across all API routes for prior reports and case files.
- **Data Integrity**: Implemented relational table migration for case-files for improved data consistency.
- **System Limits**: Automated stripping of base64 images from case files to prevent `SQLITE_TOOBIG` storage limits.
- **API Parsing**: Corrected array response parsing for the unified case files library.
- **CI/CD**: Optimized CodeQL security workflows for pushes and fork pull requests.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-03
Three high-impact architectural upgrades for a fast, searchable, and responsive clinical simulation platform.

### ✨ Added
- **AI Streaming Support**: Shifted report generation to an asynchronous token stream for a real-time, responsive typing effect.
- **Deep Content Search (FTS5)**: Integrated an SQLite-native Full-Text Search virtual table in D1.
- **Persistence (Offline-First)**: Added `@tanstack/react-query-persist-client` for persistent browser-side caching.
- **Search Triggers**: Automated SQL triggers in D1 to keep the search index synchronized with the live `reports` table.

### 🛠️ Changed
- **API (api.ts)**: Enhanced the client layer with `AsyncGenerator` support for AI streams.
- **Repository UI**: Swapped local filtering for server-side Full-Text Search for deep repository queries.
- **Dashboard Speed**: Queries now default to a 24-hour persistence layer for sub-millisecond tab switching.
